Features
--------

With this general learning application running on the XA-SK-GPIO sliceCARD you can issue commands from a PC serial terminal operating via the Slice Card Uart to:

   * Turn LEDS on and off
   * Read the room temperature via the ADC and display on the terminal console
   * Display button presses on the terminal console
